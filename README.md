# Assessing-Common-Attack-Vectors

## Objective
In this lab, I will explore several common attack vectors, including injection-based attacks, malware-based attacks, denial-of-service attacks, and social engineering attacks.

### Skills Learned
- Understand how common cyber-attacks are performed and prevented.
- Conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection attacks against a vulnerable web application.
- Generate malware with a reverse shell payload to be delivered through a web browser.
- Compromise the availability of a web server using a distributed denial-of-service attack.
- Use social engineering techniques to extract sensitive financial information from a target.


### Tools and Software Used
- OWASP Juice Shop
- Firefox Web Developer Tools
- Metasploit Framework
- Irssi
- Social Engineering Toolkit (SET)
- Thunderbird

### Topology
- vWorkstation (Windows: Server 2016)
- pfSense (FreeBSD: pfSense)
- WebServer01 (Linux: Ubuntu 20)
- TargetWindows02 (Windows: Server 2019)
- AttackLinux01 (Linux: Kali)
- TargetPi (Raspberry Pi OS)
- DebNet (Linux: Debian 11) [contains additional Docker hosts]
-TargetLinux02 (Linux: Ubuntu 20)


### Lab Overview
STEP 1 of this lab has two parts, which should be completed in the order specified.
 
- I will learn about injection attacks using a vulnerable web application.
- I will package and deploy malware using the Metasploit framework.

STEP 2
- You will compromise the availability of a web server using a botnet and use social engineering techniques to trick your target into sharing sensitive financial information.
